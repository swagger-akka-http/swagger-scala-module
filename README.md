# Swagger Scala Module

![Build Status](https://github.com/swagger-akka-http/swagger-scala-module/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.swagger-akka-http/swagger-scala-module_2.13/badge.svg?style=plastic)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.swagger-akka-http/swagger-scala-module_2.13)

This is a fork of https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-scala-module.

| Release | Supports |
| ------- | -------- |
| 2.7.x | Scala 2 builds reintroduce scala-reflect dependency and can now introspect better on inner types. See section on `Treatment of Option` below. |
| 2.6.x/2.5.x | First releases to support Scala 3. Jackson 2.13, [jakarta](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Swagger-2.X---Getting-started) namespace jars. [OpenAPI 3.0.1](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) / [Swagger-Core](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core) 2.0.x. |
| 2.4.x | First releases to support [jakarta](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Swagger-2.X---Getting-started) namespace jars. Jackson 2.12, [OpenAPI 3.0.1](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) / [Swagger-Core](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core) 2.0.x. |
| 2.3.x | [OpenAPI 3.0.1](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) / [Swagger-Core](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core) 2.0.x. |
| 1.3.0 | [Swagger Specification 2](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/) / [Swagger-Core](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core) 1.6.x. |

## Usage
To enable the swagger-scala-module, include the appropriate version in your project:

```
  "com.github.swagger-akka-http" %% "swagger-scala-module" % "2.7.2"
```

## How does it work?
Including the library in your project allows the swagger extension module to discover this module, bringing in the appropriate jackson library in the process.  You can then use scala classes and objects in your swagger project.

## Treatment of `Option` and `required`
All properties, besides those wrapped in `Option` or explicitly set via annotations `@Schema(required = false, implementation = classOf[Int])`, default to `required = true`  in the generated swagger model. See [#7](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-scala-module/issues/7)

With Collections (and Options), scala primitives are affected by type erasure. You may need to declare the type using a Schema annotation.
```
case class AddOptionRequest(number: Int, @Schema(required = false, implementation = classOf[Int]) number2: Option[Int] = None)
```

Alternatively, you can non-primitive types like BigInt to avoid this requirement.

Since v2.7.2 release, Scala 2 builds use scala-reflect jar to try to work out the class information for the inner types. Scala 3 builds cannot use this approach, and are therefore still affected by this issue. See https://github.com/swagger-akka-http/swagger-scala-module/issues/117.
